# rndblocks

## What is rndblocks?
This is a simple mod for minecraft. It adds blocks and items of no specified theme
to simple help make minecraft a much more interesting place to be. Now for now its 
just going to a test bed for now. So what will be in the mod. Well stuff that annoys
me in regular vanilla will be added to this mod. This means that will I'm playing 
vanilla minecraft I'm going to create a simple list of thing that could help me. Now
an exmaple of what will not be here is something on the lines of automatic diamond
spawner. That in my opinion is cheating and breaks game mechanics.
